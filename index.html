      <p>
Designers today face a new paradigm in which readers have become users, more cohesively utilizing digital means of mass communication and information exchange. As a graphic designer I find the utilization of web browsers as the most effective and relevant means in which we can work within this phenomenon.
Re- as a modular platform gives the user more power over design and content structure, which in turn works by cutting out unnecessary noise from a webpage. It functions as a more focused work tool which is exponentially efficient and reliable in terms of reading experience and information consumption on the web. Re- shifts the userâ€™s experience of reading information and browsing the web; users decide which information they want to see, by completely customising their browsing experience.
